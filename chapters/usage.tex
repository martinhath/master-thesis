node.}
\end{figure}

We begin by looking at an implementation of a conurrent stack, which is arguably the simplest
concurrent data strucutre. The definitions of the \code{Stack} and \code{Node} structs and the two
most important operations on a stack, \code{push} and \code{pop}, is shown in \cref{lst:stack-ops}.
We look at each one in turn. Construction of the stack is omitted for brevity.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\input{listings/stack-ops}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Push}

\fixme{06/05 19:14 After writing \ref{sec:common-patterns}, revisit this}
\code{push} allocates the stack node itself, so it takes the value we want to push onto the stack
\coderef{ST5}. We start out by declaring two \code{Guard}s \coderef{ST6}: one for the new node we
allocate, and one for the head of the stack. We must protect the head of the stack, since the node
may be removed after we read its address, and we would have a dangling pointer.  Next we allocate a
new \code{node} \coderef{ST7}, which is done outside the retry loop so that we only have to
allocate one time per call to \code{push}. Now we enter the retry loop, which we repeat until we
succeed in changing the top pointer of the stack to our new node.
The top node is read \coderef{ST8}, and the \code{next} pointer of the new node is set to the head
\fixme{06/05 19:14 write something on \code{unsafe} here}
\coderef{ST9}. If we succeed of chaning the \code{top}  pointer of the stack to our new node, we
break out of the loop and return \coderef{ST10}. If not, we retry until we do.


\subsubsection{Pop}

\code{pop} is similar to \code{push}. We declare two \code{Guard}s \coderef{ST13}, but this time they
are for the first and second node in the stack. We read the \code{top} pointer \coderef{ST14}, and
return from the function if it is \code{null} using the \code{?} Rust operator. We then read the
next pointer of the node \coderef{ST15}; here the \code{null} case is the same as the
non-\code{null} case. We try to swap the head pointer from the first to the second node
\coderef{ST16}; if we fail we restart, and if we succeed we move out the \code{Node} from the
\code{Guard}. This is an \code{unsafe} operation, as the type is copied out of its original place,
effectively aliasing it. At last, the data is returned.

As an example of why reading and returning the node data is \code{unsafe} in the general case,
consider two threads $T\sb{1}$ and $T\sb{2}$ using a \code{Stack<Box<T>>}. $T\sb{1}$ is looking at
a node $n$, and $T\sb{2}$ is \code{pop}ping $n$ from the stack, getting the \code{Box<T>} back from
it. Now $T\sb{2}$ \code{drop}s the \code{Box}, which frees the pointer. If $T\sb{1}$ decides to
look at the data in $n$, it will dereference a freed pointer, which is a use-after-free
(\cref{def:use-after-free}). \fixme{06/05 19:14 fix this argument please} Despite being \code{unsafe} in the
general case, it is safe for the implementation of the stack as presented, since no operation on
the stack looks at the data of a node, except in \coderef{ST17}, where only one thread may be for
any given node, since we succeed the \code{cas} operation.




\section{Lock-free Queue\label{sec:usage-queue}}


\fixme{06/05 19:14 refs here pls. Explain how it works?}
The queue implemented is based on the well known Michael-Scott Queue from~\cite{michael1996simple}.
\code{push} is shown in \cref{lst:msqueue}; \code{pop} is omitted due to its similarity with
\code{Stack::pop}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\input{listings/msqueue}
\end{figure}

We start out by declaring three \code{Guard}s \coderef{MS3}: one for the new node, one for the
current tail, and one for the tails \code{next} node, which may be present.  We load \code{tail}
\coderef{MS5}, and its \code{next} pointer \coderef{MS7}.  Since the Michael-Scott queue is always
non-empty, we know that the \code{head} is non-\code{null}, and it is therefore safe to promote the
\code{NullablePtr} to a \code{Ptr} using \code{.unwrap()}.  If the next pointer is non-\code{null}
the node we believed was the tail was not the tail after all. We try to swing \code{tail} from the
node we read, to its next node \coderef{MS8} before restarting.  If the tail was \code{null} we try
to \code{cas} its next field from \code{null} to our new node \coderef{MS9}. If we succeed, we
\code{cas} the tail to our node and exit. If we fail, we restart.  Note that we do not check the
results of the the \code{cas} where we set the tail to the node we just inserted; if this operation
fails, it just means that some other thread came along and noticed that \code{tail} was not the
real tail, and \code{cas}ed it to the last node \coderef{MS8}.

\section{Lock-free List}

\fixme{07/05 22:22 insert more stuf here?}
Michael introduced a concurrent List in~\cite{harris2001pragmatic}. The list is similar to the
Stack from \cref{sec:usage-stack}, but we support more operations than \code{push} and \code{pop},
including queries and removals, and insertions into the list. Definitions of \code{List} are very
similar to that of the \code{Stack} and \code{Queue}, and is therefore omitted here.

Having arbitrary \code{insert} and \code{remove} opens for a problem known as \emph{double-remove},
shown in \cref{fig:list-remove}. Let there be two threads in the system $T\sb{1}$ and $T\sb{2}$,
and let A, B, and C be three consecutive nodes in the list. If $T\sb{1}$ wants to remove the B
node, there is a small window in which $T\sb{2}$ may insert a new node, X, between B and C. When
$T\sb{1}$s \code{cas} operation succeeds --- note that \code{A.next} was not touched by $T\sb{2}$
--- it will accidently swing the pointer past the new node X without noticing. This is a variant of
the ABA problem (\cref{sec:aba-problem}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\input{figures/list-remove}
\caption{Double removal with \code{List::remove}\label{fig:list-remove}.}
\end{figure}

A solution to this problem, as shown by Harris in~\cite{michael2002high}, is to exploit memory
alignment on modern CPU architectures: \code{struct}s are \emph{aligned} in memory, meaning their
address is a multiple of some power of two. This causes the least significant bits of their address
to always be zero; bits that may be used for other purposes. We use the least significant bit in
the \code{.next} field in a node for a \emph{tag}, signaling that the node is logically deleted,
and should not be acted upon. To see how this helps the problem as shown above, $T\sb{1}$ would
start out the deletion process of B by calling \code{cas(B.next, C, with_tag(C, 1))}. Should this
fail, $T\sb{1}$ can just read \code{B.next} again, and retry. When it succeeds, it may try to
\code{cas} \code{A.next} over B to C. Now $T\sb{2}$ realizes that it should not insert X between B
and C, since it reads the tag of B, realizing that it was deleted.


\subsection{The Entry API}

Many of the most interesting operations on the List involves iterating through the list. Due to the
ownership and lifetime rules that Rust imposes, it may be tricky to implement typical iteration
and juggle pointers around. For this reason, the API uses an indirection for iterating through the
list: \code{Entry}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\input{listings/list-entry}
\end{figure}

An \code{Entry} is like a pointer into the list, which can \code{step()} to the next node, get a
pointer to the \code{current()} node, \code{remove} the current node, insert a new node between
(\code{insert_between}) two nodes, and find nodes which data satisfies arbitrary closures
\code{Fn(T) -> bool}.  Since there is some overhead in declaring a \code{Guard}, \code{Entry}
contains two references to \code{Guard}s rather than the \code{Guard}s themselves. This makes
construting a \code{Guard} nearly free.  Another implication of this is that \code{Entry} is
movable in memory (as \code{Guard} is not).

This indirection simplifies many operations, and we barely need to deal with lifetime and ownership
issues, although it almost requires \gls{nll} (\cref{sec:nll}) to use.

\section{Lock-free Hash Table}

The hash table is a versatile and popular data structure. It is widely used due to its constant time
operations, including queries, insertions, and removals.

Lock-free hash tables are interesting for the same reasons. Despite the interest, designing a
concurrent hash table turns out to be a difficult problem. Blabl, resize
Most hash tables are split up in \emph{buckets}, such that the hash of the elements within a bucket
share some property (eg.\ a common prefix). Increasing the number of buckets is knows as
\emph{resizing}, which makes sure that the number of elements in each bucket is limited; many
algorithms and hash functions give bounds on the number of elements in each bucket.

\subsection{Split-Ordered List}

We start by describing the \emph{Split-Ordered List}. Split-Ordered Lists were introduced
in~\cite{shalev2006split}. The nodes in the list is ordered by the \emph{reverse hash} of the value
in the node. In addition, the list contains \emph{sentinel nodes}, which are the beginnings of the
buckets in the hash table. By making the number of buckets $b=2\sp{k}$ we can double $b$ when the
load factor is too high, and insert one more sentinel node between each of the nodes already
present, effectively differentiating between one new bit of the reverse hash.

\subsection{Hash Table}
\fixme{07/05 17:00 Clean up these sections. Maybe have only one section?}

Using the Split-Ordered List we can implement a concurrent hash table by having an array of
pointers to sentinel nodes, and a ``size'' of the bucket array. If a sentinel pointer is
\code{null}, then the node is not yet in the table. When inserting a new element into the table, we
first find the sentinel node that precedes the node we want to insert (the \emph{parent}); this is
known, since we know the ordering of the nodes in the list --- the reverse hash. However, due to
the resizing method, the parent may not have been inserted yet. If not, we can simply recurse on
the insertion method, and insert the parent first. Then, we simply iterate through the list, and
find the place in which our new node should be. Assuming a small load factor, this is a fast
operation.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\input{figures/hashmap}
\caption{The Split-Ordered List. Node labels shows the \code{hash} and its reverse in
parenthesis.\label{fig:split-order-list}}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:split-order-list} shows the split-ordered list with a table size of $4$. The nodes in the
list are ordered by the reverse of their hash (shown in parenthesis). Given a node \code{n}, we
find the sentinel node that should preceed it in the list by taking \code{hash(n) \% table_size}.
Note that this is not the reverse hash. For instance,
inserting a node where \code{hash(n) == 7}, we look in bucket \code{7 \% 4 == 3}, and iterate from
sentinel node 3.
Inserting a node where \code{hash(n) == 10}, we would get \code{bucket = 2}, which is \code{null},
so we need to insert the sentinel node first.


We look at $n$ operations on the hash table: \code{contains}, \code{insert}, $and\ maybe\ more$.

\subsection{Contains}

\cref{lst:hashmap-contains} shows the implementation of \code{HashMap::contains}. The
implementation of utility functions such as \code{bucket_and_revhash} are omitted for brevity.  We
find the \code{parent} node \coderef{HC4}, and use the \code{Entry} API from \code{List}
\coderef{HC6} to look for the first node which hash and key is the same; if we encounter a node
which hash is more than our node, we know that we have gone too far. \code{Entry::seek_with_opt}
lets us break out of the search early by returning \code{None} \coderef{HC10}. If we find a node
with both the right hash and the right key, we return \code{Some(true)} from the
closure \coderef{HC11}, and \code{seek_with_opt} returns \code{Ok}. If we get back \code{Ok}, the
search succeeded, so we return \code{true}, and \code{false} otherwise.
\input{listings/hashmap-contains}


\subsection{Insert}
\code{HashMap::insert} is more complicated, as there are multiple things that can go wrong, and
that some operations require cleanup. \cref{lst:hashmap-insert} shows the implementation of
\code{insert}.

\input{listings/hashmap-insert}

We start out by hashing the \code{key}, finding the reverse hash \coderef{HI3} and the bucket of
the sentienl node, and a pointer to the node is acquired \coderef{HI4}. We declare five (!)
\code{Guard}s \coderef{HI5}, and \code{alloc} our new node \coderef{HI7}.
Next we make our \code{entry} from the sentinel \coderef{HI9}, and find the correct place to put
our new node \coderef{HI10}. The new node is put before any other nodes with the same hash, but
after the sentinel node, should their hashes be the same. We insert the new node in front of the
old nodes so that other threads will see the most recently updated node first. The result of this
operation has three cases:
\begin{enumerate*}[1) ]
  \item we fail with \code{Empty} which means we got to the end of the list, and is handled by
    inserting the new node at the end of the list  \coderef{HI14},
  \item we fail with another failure case and restart \coderef{HI19}, and
  \item we succeed and actually insert our new node into the list \coderef{HI20}, where we, again,
    restart upon failure.
\end{enumerate*}

After insertion we must check for other nodes with the same key, since there should only be one
entry for any given key in the map \coderef{HI21}. This is done by making a new \code{Entry} with
the new node, \code{step}ping once, so that the \code{current} node is not our new node, and
\code{delete()} any node that has the right key.  When we hit a node which hash is more than our
own, we are done \coderef{HI24}.  Since the map is generic over the key type \code{K}, comparing
the type for equality might be expensive. Therefore, we check the hash before checking the key for
equality \coderef{HI25}.

\code{HashMap::insert} contains a single \code{unsafe} block: \coderef{HI14}. This operation is
\code{unsafe} since we are mutating \code{new_node}, which potentially could cause a race condition
if the node was concurrently read by another thread. However, we know that it is not read by any
other thread, since we have not been succesfull yet in inserting it into the list.

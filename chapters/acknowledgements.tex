This thesis is presented in partial fultilment of the requirements for the degree Master of Science
at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in the spring of 2018. The topic of this
thesis has been worked out in part from a semester project in the fall of 2017 and discussions with
the members of the Distributed Algorithms and Systems research group by Dan Alitarh at IST Austria.


\subsection*{Acknowledgements}

The writing of this thesis has been a long project, but it has also been a very rewarding one.  I
would like to thank my advisor, Magnus Lie Hetland, for helping me through the project, despite my
lack of questions for him.  I would also like to thank IST Austria, and Dan Alistarh in particular,
for offering me an internship, and later inviting me back for two weeks, while I was planning and
working on this thesis.

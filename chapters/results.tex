\chapter{Results}

In this chapter we look at the expermental results of the system as a whole. In \cref{ch:res-ops}
we look at the overhead of the operations done by CMR. In \cref{ch:res-ds} we look at the
performance of the data structuers implemented, with and without the overehead CMR, and compare
them to alternatives in the Rust ecosystem, like Crossbeam\cite{crossbeam} and data structures in
the standard library wrapped in a \code{Mutex}.

\section{Operations of CMR\label{ch:res-ops}}

The operations that CMR provides that are most interesting to look at is allocation
(\code{cmr::alloc}) and guard initialization and destruction (\code{guard!}), as these operations
are the only ones that have any significant overhead. Atomic loads pointer manipulations are mainly
tricks of the type system to ensure the safey of the operations, and has no run-time overhead.

% TODO: actually do this (issue #1)
It is also interesting to look at the overhead of \code{fork()} calls, as this is an important part
of the way CMR works.


The results are primarily from a \fixme{30/05 13:57 insert IST machine here}. We have also ran the
full benchmark suite on other machines\fixme{30/05 13:58 consider this after getting IST results}.
Interesting results are shown. The complete dataset of all results on all machines are listed in
\cref{ap:results}


\section{Data Structures\label{ch:res-ds}}

We look at all data structuers in the order that they were introduced in \cref{ch:usage}.

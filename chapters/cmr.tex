The high level idea of the system is for the consolidator to have easy access to all roots in every
thread. With this information, the problem of identifying garbage is equivalent to reachability
analysis in a graph in which the vertices are \code{struct}s and the edges are pointers.

The central data type to achieve this is \code{Guard}. A \code{Guard} is an object in which
a pointer to shared memory is stored.
